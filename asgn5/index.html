Notes to Grader:

Uhhh so I just added a custom car model and added animation going along the path. It was kinda a pain to figure out
how to export the car model from blender with all of the materials, cause it kept leaving out the textures
on one of the sides of the car (tires, passenger mirror, door handles). I had to export an FBX file back to a 
gltf file.
